**AgriLens** is an AI-powered web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using Deep Learning. The system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on over 5,000+ plant leaf images to identify diseases with **92%+ accuracy** and provides disease-specific fertilizer recommendations and treatment tips. A multilingual interface improves accessibility for farmers and users from different linguistic backgrounds.

## ⚡ Recent Deployment & Model Optimization (Why TFLite?)

To host the AI model reliably on cloud infrastructure without exceeding server RAM limits, the model pipeline underwent key architectural optimizations:

### 🔬 Why TensorFlow Lite (`Team3model.tflite`)?

1. **20x File Size Reduction (Quantization):**  
   The original Keras `.h5` model file was **709 MB**. Using TFLite dynamic range quantization (`tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT`), the model size was reduced down to **35.2 MB** without loss of prediction accuracy.

2. **95% Memory (RAM) Reduction:**  
   Loading a 709 MB HDF5 CNN model into TensorFlow memory consumed **~1,100 MB RAM**, causing cloud container Out-Of-Memory (`SIGKILL` 137) crashes on standard 512MB RAM tiers.  
   `tf.lite.Interpreter` loads flatbuffer tensors directly, consuming only **~60 MB RAM** during inference!

3. **30x Faster Inference Speed:**  
   Prediction runtime dropped from **4.5 seconds down to 0.15 seconds per image**.

4. **Instant Health Checks & Zero-Downtime Daemon Warmup:**  
   Wrapped model pre-warming in a background daemon thread so Gunicorn binds to the server port immediately, returning `200 OK` on `/health` within 1 second.

| Metric | Original Keras `.h5` Model | ⚡ Quantized TFLite Model |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Size** | 709.2 MB | **35.2 MB** *(20x smaller)* |
| **RAM Usage in Server** | ~1,100 MB | **~60 MB RAM** *(Zero OOM crashes)* |
| **Inference Latency** | ~4.5 seconds | **~0.15 seconds** *(30x faster)* |
| **Accuracy** | 92.0% | **92.0%** *(100% Identical)* |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Open the **[AgriLens Web Application](https://agrilens.up.railway.app/)**.
2. Select a plant leaf image from your device or capture one directly using your camera.
3. The image is preprocessed into a $256 \times 256 \times 3$ normalized RGB tensor array.
4. The lightweight TFLite CNN Interpreter executes matrix inference in ~0.15 seconds.
5. The application generates a **Plant Health Report** displaying:
   - **Predicted Disease / Healthy Status**
   - **Fertilizer Recommendation**
   - **Treatment & Prevention Tips**
6. Users can toggle seamlessly between **English** and **Telugu** at any time.
